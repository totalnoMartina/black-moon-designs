For the start, the css was not loading background linear so I used [stackoverflow](www.stackoverflow.com) and found [this solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45134867/css-html-how-to-stop-linear-gradient-from-repeating-vertically-and-horizontall).
The [MyColor](https://mycolor.space) was used to help choose colors. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for selection of fonts for the website.
Finding a cool navigation was not an easy task but [here](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/b4/jquery/navigation/hamburger-menu/) I found one that suits.
